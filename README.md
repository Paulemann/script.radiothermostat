# script.radiothermostat
This kodi addon enables control of most 3M RadioThermostat units (CT30, CT50 and CT80).
Enter the IP and Name of 1 or 2 devices connected to your internal network, and select if you want to display temperatures in Farenheit or Celsius. The thermostat Mode, Fan, Hold and Temperature settings can be adjusted on the main screen, once values are changed, apply them by pressing the "Set Values" button. Values are refreshed automatically in a configurable time interval or by pressing the "Reload" button when needed.
